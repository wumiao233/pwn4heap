## 📖 Overview

This repository presents an enhanced and practical extension of the renowned **how2heap** tutorial. While the original **how2heap** provides foundational examples of heap exploitation techniques in C, this project advances further by integrating production-ready Python Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits and modifying vulnerable programs to enable real-world shell acquisition capabilities.

The primary objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical vulnerability demonstrations and practical exploitation. Moving beyond simple proof-of-concepts that might only show control flow hijacking or arbitrary writes, this work focuses on achieving actual code execution in realistic contexts. This involves adapting the original **how2heap** examples to create exploitable conditions that can lead to shell access, thereby providing a more hands-on and impactful learning experience for understanding heap vulnerabilities.

## ✨ Features

- **Comprehensive Heap Exploitation**: Extends basic how2heap examples with practical implementations
- **Production-Ready PoCs**: Python-based exploits designed for real-world scenarios
- **Structured Learning**: Organized by glibc versions and exploitation techniques
- **Hands-On Approach**: Focuses on achieving actual shell execution rather than theoretical concepts

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3
- GCC compiler
- Make utility
- Authorized testing environment

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/BinRacer/pwn4heap.git
   cd pwn4heap
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```shell
   uv sync
   # pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies**:
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install gawk bison gcc-multilib g++-multilib -y
   ```

### Usage Guide

1. **Navigate to your desired technique**:
   ```shell
   cd src/2.23/unsorted_bin_leak
   ```

2. **Synchronize and adjust parameters** in the Python exploit file before rebuilding the binary

3. **Rebuild and execute**:
   ```shell
   make rebuild
   python exploit.py
   ```
